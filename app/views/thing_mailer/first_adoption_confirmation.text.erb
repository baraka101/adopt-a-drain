Hi <%= @user.name.split.first %>!

You just adopted one of daresalaam drains.
Congratulations and thank you for helping to protect the environment, manage
stormwater, and minimize flooding.

Safety tips:

* Never try to lift the drain grate.
* Clear from the sidewalk, not the street. Wear reflective clothing so vehicles
  can see you.
* Always wear gloves and be careful of sharp objects!
* Use a rake, shovel, or broom and dustpan - not your hands.

How to care for your drain:

* If possible, clear the drain before it starts raining.
* Put leaves and other natural material in the green compost bin.
* Put trash and debris in the black garbage bin.
* Clear about 10 feet on both sides of the drain.
* Medical waste or needles? Construction debris? Toxic materials? If it's an
  emergency, call 

If the drain is too dirty or hard to clear or there's some other problem with
the drain, contact 311 to have it cleared by the City.

Thanks again, <%= @user.name.split.first %>, for adopting a drain in our fair
city. When each of us helps out a little, it makes a big difference!

Sincerely,

Your friends at the daresalaam Public Utilities Commission

Please be careful!
